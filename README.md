# POCS Debugging Utils
Collection of random test scripts useful for first time setup and debugging of hardware on panoptes units. Directions for usage of each script are contained as comments within each one. Scripts have been tested on a unit,
but not all units. There are no gaurentees that they will function properly, especially if there have been significant updates to POCS or if your unit has custom hardware.
